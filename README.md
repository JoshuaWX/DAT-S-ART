# Dat's Art - Bringing Technology into Art

This is a personal website I'm building for my friend who explores the intersection of code and creativity. They believe art doesn't have to be limited to traditional mediums - code can be just as expressive as paint or clay. The site showcases their digital art experiments, from generative algorithms to interactive web experiences. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because sometimes the best art comes from understanding your tools at a fundamental level. Visitors can explore the gallery, learn about their process, and maybe get inspired to create something themselves. The whole thing is responsive and has some fun interactive elements - I couldn't help myself from adding animated particles and glitch effects because that's just how they express their art.
