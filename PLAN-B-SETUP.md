# Plan B: Use Netlify for CMS, Vercel for Main Site

Since we're having integration issues with the Vercel CMS setup, let's implement the simpler and more reliable approach:

## Setup Summary:
- **Main Website**: Keep using Vercel (visitors use this URL)
- **Content Management**: Use Netlify site for CMS (you use this for admin work)
- **Content Sync**: Both sites pull from the same GitHub repository

## How It Works:
1. You manage content at: `https://kaleidoscopic-tanuki-14c719.netlify.app/admin`
2. Changes get saved to your GitHub repository
3. Vercel automatically updates your main site when GitHub changes
4. Visitors use your Vercel site as normal

## Steps to Complete:

### 1. Enable Identity on Netlify (if not done)
- Go to your Netlify site dashboard
- Identity tab → "Enable Identity"
- Settings → Identity → Services → "Enable Git Gateway"
- Add your GitHub token (the one you shared earlier)

### 2. Invite Yourself
- Identity → "Invite users" → Add your email
- Accept invitation and set password

### 3. Use CMS
- Go to: `https://kaleidoscopic-tanuki-14c719.netlify.app/admin`
- Login with your credentials
- Manage your gallery and featured art
- Changes automatically sync to your main Vercel site

## Benefits of This Approach:
✅ **Simpler setup** - No complex integration needed
✅ **More reliable** - Uses Netlify's native CMS support  
✅ **Same functionality** - You can still manage all content easily
✅ **Fast main site** - Vercel remains your primary hosting
✅ **Automatic sync** - Changes appear on Vercel automatically

## What You Need to Do:
1. Make sure Git Gateway is enabled on Netlify with your GitHub token
2. Invite yourself as a user on Netlify
3. Use the Netlify URL for content management
4. Keep using your Vercel URL for your main website

This is actually a very common and professional setup used by many websites!
